# How to contribute to PISA

Thank you for reading this and for considering to contribute to PISA! We always need volunteer developers to help move this project forward.

## Submitting changes
Found a bug or missing a functionality? Don't be afraid to tackle this! If you don't do it, maybe no one will.

#### Open an issue
In any case, it is a good first step to document what you've found (or what's missing) in a GitHub issue.

#### Close an issue
If you want to work on something already documented, you are more than welcome! But remember, the best way to close an issue is with a pull request.

#### Open a pull request
Once you implemented your changes, you can start a PR. You can start this early, even when you are still working on your code, to get feedback and let people know what you are working on. Use your own fork and/or a dedicated branch for your PR.

#### Review and merge a pull request
Everyone can (and should) review and merge PRs opened by other contributors. You can also just review and wait for others to merge, if you are unsure about the proposed changes. 

## Coding conventions
Coding conventions can be found in [Conventions](pisa/general_conventions.md).

## Testing
If you add a feature, add a test that proves it works. More about tests can be found in [Conventions](pisa/general_conventions.md).

## Ask for help
If you are stuck with you code or have some generel questions, feel free to ask other people on slack (e.g. in the pisa-help channel).

**Thanks a lot and good coding :)**
